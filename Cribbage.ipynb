    "Simple script to choose optimal cards for a cribbage hand. Ignores the play section of the game and only tries to maximize points in the player's hand/crib while minimizing points in the opponent's crib. The script uses a simple montecarlo approach to evaluate the number of points from a given selection of cards. The tricky part is estimating what the opponent will put in the crib-- the simplest implementation of picking two cards randomly works well enough, but slightly improved performance can come (at a large runtime cost) from simulating the opponent picking their own cards to determine what they are likely to put in the crib."
